# The folllowing is a summary of the most popular open source licenses on the most important provisions, i.e. how to redistribute and contribute. For the detailed text please refer to the relevant license itself.#

Apache 2.0

Apache can be applied to either patents or copyrights. The required grant is pretty broad and specific - Rights are perpetual (forever); worldwide (can be used anywhere), no-charge, royalty free, and irrovocable (once you grant the right  you can't rescind it). 

In order to redistribute any work licensed under Apache, you must 1) redistribute with a copy of the license; 2) any modified files must carry prominent notices stating you modified it; 3) must retain all legal notices and 4) if the work contains a "NOTICE" file as part of the distribution, then any derivative work must be distributed with a readable copy of that file. The content of the NOTICE file is for informational purposes only and does not modify the license, any added language is permitted so long as it cannot be construed to modify the license. 

Contributions submitted to the Licensor will also be governed under the same T&C's. Having said so, the license will not supersede any license agreement you might otherwise have with the licensor.
