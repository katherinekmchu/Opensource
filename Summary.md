# The folllowing is a summary of the most popular open source licenses on the most important provisions, i.e. how to redistribute and contribute. For the detailed text please refer to the relevant license itself.#

>
Apache 2.0 
>
Apache can be applied to either patents or copyrights. The required grant is pretty broad and specific - Rights are perpetual (forever); worldwide (can be used anywhere), no-charge, royalty free, and irrovocable (once you grant the right  you can't rescind it). 

In order to redistribute any work licensed under Apache, you must 1) redistribute with a copy of the license; 2) any modified files must carry prominent notices stating you modified it; 3) must retain all legal notices and 4) if the work contains a "NOTICE" file as part of the distribution, then any derivative work must be distributed with a readable copy of that file. The content of the NOTICE file is for informational purposes only and does not modify the license, any added language is permitted so long as it cannot be construed to modify the license. 

Contributions submitted to the Licensor will also be governed under the same T&C's. Having said so, the license will not supersede any license agreement you might otherwise have with the licensor. 

>BSD License

BSD licenses are very permissive (i.e. with little restrictions or requirements). 

The BSD 3- Clause license permits redistribution and use in source and binary form, with or without modification, as long as you redistribute with all the copyright, conditions and disclaimer intact. A copy of copyright, conditions and disclaimer can be obtained [here](http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause). The BSD 2 - Clause is simply a simplified version which omits clause 3 which disclaims any endorsements by the copyright holder/ its contributors. 

>GNU is the strongest proponent of using the word "Free" as opposed to "Open", the foundation of their philosophy is that *Free software ... means that users have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software. Thus "free software" is a matter of liberty, not price.... think of "free" as in "free speech" and not as in "free beer".*
>GNU is sometimes also known as a "copyleft" license because it is a method for making a program (or work) free, and requires all modified and extended versions of the program to be free as well. 

**GPU General Public License, version 2 (GPL -2.0)**
The GPL 2.0 license permits the copying and distribution of verbatim copies of the program's **source code**, in any medium, as long as you publish along with each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty, and keep intact all legal notices, including a copy of the license. GPL 2.0 also allows for copying and distribution of works in **object code** or **executable form** as long as it is accompanied with complete machine-readable source code; written offer (valid for at least 3 years) to charge for the distribution of corresponding source code but such charge must not be more than your cost of physically performing such source distribution, and accompany with the copy any information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. 

In terms of modifications (i.e. derivative work), such is permitted as long as you i) cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and date of change; ii) license any derivative at no charge to any third parties and under the terms of this license; and iii) if the program normally reads commands interactively when run (i.e. would normally print announcements when run) then you must cause it to print/display the appropriate copyright notice and a no warranty disclaimer (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions and info about how to obtain a copy of the license. 

**GPU General Public License, version 3 (GPL -3.0)**
GPL v.3 contains the basic intent of GPL v.2 but strongly amends it to cover some technical and legal issues.
